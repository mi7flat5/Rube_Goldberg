Industrial Pumps & Pipes

Warning :

These meshes are not grid drop in friendly.

These meshes were designed to allow the user the maximum flexibility while building their creations. 
 In other words you can build just about any shape and length,and somewhat size of piping ,but you are going to  need to adjust things to fit. 
 These parts fit together while using the "V" key in move mode, by selecting the vertice you want to align to another part. 
 This can be a bit fiddly and time consuming at  times.

Please read the User Guide to see how things were meant to go together and make sure it is going to be ok for you.

Thanks
