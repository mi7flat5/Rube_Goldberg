# Rube_Goldberg
Shane Harmon Udacity High Emerision VR project 1<br><br>
This project was made with Unity 5.5.3 for the HTC Vive only. <br><br>
This project took about 20-30 hours of development time. <br><br>
The most enjoyable part of this project was creating the unique behaviors for all of the Rube Goldberg items. 
The most challenging aspect was debugging VR, putting on and taking off the headset takes a toll after a while. 
Also launching a scene while steam VR is not on will cause a "Blue Screen", this destroyed one of my scenes and 
took a few hours to redo.  <br><br>

I took a few liberties with button choices and which hand the menu was on for the sake of playability. My playtester and I felt that this settup was a little more intuitive.
